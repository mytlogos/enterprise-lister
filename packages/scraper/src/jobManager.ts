 * A Job Queue which queues Jobs to start.
 * The queue may define a Memory Limit after which
 * no new Jobs are queued right away and a number of
 * Jobs which can be active at the same time.
 *
 * The Queue itself is unbounded, there can be as many Jobs
 * queued as there is memory.
 * (TODO: what if there so many jobs queued that a given Memory Limit is exceeded?)
 * The Queue can be paused, started, but will
 * queue new Jobs regardless of the state of the queue.
 *
 * A Job runs in a Async Context and has access
 * to a Map as store, which can be accessed with the
 * asyncStorage.getStore API.
 *
 * A Job is schedulable if there is room between the number
 * of maximum active jobs and the number of currently active jobs.
 *
 * The Queue has two scheduling phases in which the rate of
 * checking for schedulable Jobs differ:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Full: Checks every 0.5s</li>
 *     <li>Constrained: Checks every 1s</li>
 * </ol>
 * It switches to the full rate if it had once more schedulable jobs
 * than the number of currently running jobs.
 * The queue switches to constrained if it does not have any schedulable jobs
 * or any Queue Constraints like Memory are active or the queue itself is not active (paused or stopped).
 *
 * If the Queue is paused it stops checking for schedulable jobs until it is started again.
 *
 * After a Job is executed (successfully or failed), it will be removed immediately.
